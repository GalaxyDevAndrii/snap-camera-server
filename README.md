# 👻 Snap Camera Server v3 
Host your own Snap Camera server after the shutdown on January 25, 2023.

**This code is a fork of *jaku/SnapCameraPreservation* on steroids 💪** 
- ✔️ No previously backed up files or third party server required.
- ✔️ Access all Snap Lenses from **lens.snapchat.com** without restrictions.
- ✔️ Import Lenses from local application cache e.g. `AppData\Local\Snap\Snap Camera\cache\lenses`.
- ✔️ All files will be stored inside a Docker Volume (e.g. on your local machine).
- ✔️ Works 100% on Windows without missing Lenses.

You get the full decentralized control and you can use *Snap Camera* until Doomsday.

See the [📋 Changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for a full list of changes and features.

## ⚠️ Pre-Requirements
This server requires Docker and OpenSSL and maybe 5 to 10 minutes of your time ⏲️
- [🐋 Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [🔐 OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) (Download from [slproweb.com](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) as Windows user)

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. [📥 Download the latest release](https://github.com/ptrumpis/snap-camera-server/releases/latest)
2. [🛠️ Complete the configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)

There is also a step by step [📺 Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcsjvWHUr7c) available.

## 💯 Advanced Features
### 📤 Snap Camera Cache Import 
You can import your local cached lenses through this online interface [Snap Lens Cache Import](https://ptrumpis.github.io/snap-lens-cache-import/)

Watch the [Re-Import Cache Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alo49et3QxY) if you need help.

### 🌐 Web Lens Download
All Snap Lenses are still available for download at **https://lens.snapchat.com** (hidden from view).

You need to apply a special [Snap Camera Signature Patch](https://ptrumpis.github.io/snap-camera-signature-patch/) to your `Snap Camera.exe` to get access to these web lenses. 

 *This patch is only available for Windows as of now (I don't own a Mac 🙄).*
