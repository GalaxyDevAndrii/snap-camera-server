# 👻 Snap Camera Server v3 
Host your own Snap Camera server after the shutdown on January 25, 2023.

**This code is a fork of *jaku/SnapCameraPreservation* on steroids 💪** 
- ✔️ No previously backed up files or third party server required.
- ✔️ Access all Snap Lenses from **lens.snapchat.com** without restrictions.
- ✔️ Import Lenses from local application cache e.g. `AppData\Local\Snap\Snap Camera\cache\lenses`.
- ✔️ All files will be stored inside a Docker Volume (e.g. on your local machine).
- ✔️ Works 100% on Windows and Mac OS without missing Lenses.

You get the full decentralized control and you can use *Snap Camera* until Doomsday.

See the [📋 Changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for a full list of changes and features.
